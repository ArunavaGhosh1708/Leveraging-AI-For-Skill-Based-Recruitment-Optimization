## Methodology

### Data Collection
The project collected data from multiple sources:
- **Primary Sources**: LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Kaggle, and Indeed.
- **Datasets Used**:
  - LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset
  - LinkedIn Professional Profiles Dataset
  - Data Science Job Salaries (2020â€“2024)
  - US Software Engineer Jobs Dataset
- Data included job titles, industries, skills, job locations, and salary information, ensuring a diverse representation of the job market.

### Data Preprocessing
To ensure data quality, the following preprocessing steps were implemented:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and normalized job titles across platforms.
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies in job descriptions.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Encoded job titles and skills using TF-IDF vectorization.
   - Grouped similar roles using clustering algorithms like K-Means and domain-specific probabilistic clustering.
3. **Temporal Organization**:
   - Aggregated job postings into consistent time intervals for trend analysis.

### Analysis and Modeling
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized trends in job postings, salary distributions, and remote work prevalence using bar charts, heatmaps, and line graphs.
2. **Time-Series Forecasting**:
   - Used ARIMA models to predict job demand based on historical trends.
3. **Job Recommendation System**:
   - Developed a recommendation engine that matches user input (job titles/skills) with relevant roles using TF-IDF and ANN.
